## Technical Test

Firstly, thank you for attending your first interview with us. I hope you found it an enjoyable experience, and are looking forward to showing us what you can do in this technical challenge. 

This is for us to check how well you can tackle multiple problems using your troubleshooting ability, HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

I would expect these tasks to take you between 45 minutes and 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete. 

Your tasks to complete are: 

1. Look for issues on the page layout and fix them - There are at least 5
2. Remove the area in the carousel that says "Mens Shoes" but make sure that the positioning of the other elements does not change. 
3. In the new collection area, make the black "New" button align with the top left of the shoe container
4. Add another carousel item
5. Add another item to the page navigation
5. In the new arrivals products section, change the layout to show the shoes in rows of three.
6. Using javascript, submit the form via javascript, redirecting the page back to itself. Scroll the page to the form, remove the form, and show a thank you message where the form once was. 

Please complete these changes using a pull request so that we can see exactly what changes you have made to the code. 

Thanks
