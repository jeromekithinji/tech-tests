# Intro

You’re working with an intern that keeps coming to you with JavaScript code that won’t run because the braces, brackets, and parentheses are off. To save you both some time, you decide to write a braces/brackets/parentheses validator.

Let’s say:

‘(‘, ‘{‘, ‘[‘ are called “openers.”
‘)’, ‘}’, ‘]’ are called “closers.”
Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string’s openers and closers are properly nested.

### Examples:

“{ [] ( ) }” should return 1
“{ [(] ) }” should return 0
“{ [ }” should return 0

### Starting Code

```java

/*
 * Click `Run` to execute the snippet below!
 */

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

/*
 * To execute Java, please define "static void main" on a class
 * named Solution.
 *
 * If you need more classes, simply define them inline.
 */

class Solution {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> strings = new ArrayList<String>();
    strings.add("Hello, World!");
    strings.add("Welcome to CoderPad.");
    strings.add("This pad is running Java " + Runtime.version().feature());

    for (String string : strings) {
      System.out.println(string);
    }
  }
}


```
