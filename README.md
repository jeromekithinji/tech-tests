# _Nology Tech-tests
This is a collection of Junior Software Developer tech tests. The aim is to give you exposure to a wide variety of technical assessments. Each Test is from previous student so they are real world examples of what you might get. Take each test with a pinch of salt e.g. you could use react instead of angular etc.

## Folder Structure
The first folder "00 Javascript Kata" is a collection of JS problems to solve using functions. The solutions for this are written in typescript. Each other folder contains the brief in a README.md file. Some Tests may also have a solution folder. Do not feel that is the only way to solve it.

### Set up

git clone https://github.com/nology-tech/tech-tests.git
